-- Phase 3
-- 1 Retrieve the names of players along with their total number of matches won, calculated as a percentage of their total matches played.Display the full_name along with  Win_Percentage rounded to 4 decimals
	SELECT CONCAT(p.first_name,' ',p.last_name) AS full_name,
	    ROUND((COUNT(m.winner_id) * 100.0) / p.total_matches_played,4) AS Win_Percentage
		FROM Players p
		LEFT JOIN Matches m ON p.player_id = m.winner_id
		GROUP BY p.player_id
		ORDER BY Win_Percentage DESC;

-- 2 Retrieve the match details for matches where the winner's current world ranking is among the top 5 players. Display the match date, winner's name, and the match level. 
	SELECT m.match_date, 
		CONCAT(p.first_name , ' ' , p.last_name) AS winners_full_name,
		m.match_level
		FROM Matches m
		JOIN Players p  
		ON m.winner_id = p.player_id
		WHERE p.current_world_ranking <6;

-- 3 Find the sponsors who are sponsoring the top 3 players based on their current world ranking. Display the sponsor name and the player's full name an their world ranking.
	SELECT s.sponsor_name,
		p.first_name || ' ' || p.last_name AS player_name,
	    p.current_world_ranking
		FROM Players p
		JOIN Player_Sponsors ps ON p.player_id=ps.player_id
		JOIN Sponsors s ON s.sponsor_id = ps.sponsor_id
		WHERE current_world_ranking<=3
		ORDER BY current_world_ranking;

-- 4  Create a query that retrieves the full names of all players along with a label indicating their performance in the tournament based on their match win percentage. The label should be:
-- "Excellent" if the player has won more than 75% of their matches.
-- "Good" if the player has won between 50% and 75% of their matches.
-- "Average" if the player has won between 25% and 50% of their matches.
-- "Needs Improvement" if the player has won less than 25% of their matches.
-- The query should also include the player's total number of matches played and total number of matches won. The calculation for the win percentage should be done using a subquery.

-- 5 Retrieve the names of players who have never won a match (i.e., they have participated in matches but are not listed as a winner in any match). Display their full name and current world ranking.
	SELECT CONCAT(p.first_name , ' ' , p.last_name) AS full_name,
